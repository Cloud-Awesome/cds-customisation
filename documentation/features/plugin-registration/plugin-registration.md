# Plugin Registration

> API and Command line application to register plugin assemblies, service endpoints, steps and entity images from an XML manifest. 
> 
> Write your plugins and service bus message code then comit to your repo alongside a manifest to register them without needing the Plugin registration tool to manually register each step

## Manifest

### XSD 
(Reference the version available in Blob Storage)

### Plugin Assemblies

### Service Endpoints

### Webhooks

### Custom Workflow Assemblies

## Options

### Clobber

Easier to delete all steps/images etc. and re-register than potentially have a registration failed due to badly merged plugin types

### Solutions

Structuring multiple manifests vs. multiple solutions vs. single manifests with solutions per `PluginAssembly` node to enable various team management, deployment and solution segregation strategies
