# Generate Customisations

> API and Command line application which processes a XML manifest to programatically create:
> - Entities, attributes, forms, views and global optionsets
> - Model driven apps and sitemaps
> - Security roles and field level profiles
> 
> Quickly generate, test and tear down data model and UI artifacts during prototyping phases, save time and prevent typos when generating large data models
