# Generate Customisations

> API and Command line application which processes an XML manifest to programatically create:
> - Entities, attributes, forms, views and global optionsets
> - Model driven apps and sitemaps
> - Security roles and field level profiles
> 
> Quickly generate, test and tear down data model and UI artifacts during prototyping phases, save time and prevent typos when generating large data models. Or integrate into an existing solution to migrate or synchronise data model from a 3rd party application into CDS

## Manifest

### XSD 
(Reference the version available in Blob Storage)

### Entities

### OptionSets

### Security Roles

### ModelDrivenApps

## Options

### Clobber

Easier to delete all steps/images etc. and re-register than potentially have a registration failed due to badly merged plugin types
